	<h1>Brahma kumaries introduction</h1>
	<p><big><b>Brahma Kumaris Godly Spiritual University is established by the incorporeal God-Father Shiv (the Supreme Soul) as a foundation to recreate the new heavenly world. God has come in this time when unrighteousness and ignorance is prevailing as clouds hiding the sun of knowledge. The present time is called Sangam Yug/ Confluence Age, an age or time period between Iron Age (Kaliyug) and the Golden Age (Satyug). God's role is to re-establish the world which is remembered by us as Heaven. He reminds us our true identity, that we are souls and not this physical body. This is thus Godfatherly University for world transformation. We the students here are attaining this knowledge and virtues from the spiritual father and thus the fortune of liberation in life for many many births. Through this spiritual university, we godly students are learning the truth of the creator and the creation. This whose source is Murli. When the sun rises, the night ends and the day begins. God is a conscious sun of knowledge.</b></big></p>
	<h2>our story</h2>
	<p><big><b>'Om Mandli' - as it was named, was a group of a few tens of children, mothers, young and old men, in the very beginning (late 1936) who devoted their life in the direction towards God after some or other divine experiences they received while attending a Satsang (spiritual retreat) at Dada Lekhraj's house. Right that time, not many realised the fact that it was God who was working through the medium of Dada Lekhraj. But as they received such experiences, they continued on the path. They tolerated harsh words and opposition of the whole community including their relatives, just because they followed the way of celibacy and decided to walk on the path shown by God. In spite of the incredible social upheavals which were going on in pre-partition India, these people came together, initially in Hyderabad and a year later they moved to Karachi. With time, a simple and clear body of knowledge about the nature of the soul, God and time became revealed. In 1950 (two years after Partition), the group moved to its present location of Mount Abu, India. Until then, these nearly 400 individuals lived as a self-sufficient big family, devoting their time to intense spiritual study, meditation, and self-transformation.<br>

Their undeviating faith and sacrifice became immortal. Now those souls who came in the very beginning are referred to as Dadi or Dada (with respect).<br>
Now is the time of such a transformation, which only once occurs in the whole Kalpa (cycle of 5000 years). When all the world is corrupt, vicious and in sorrow, God has to come to free all Souls, his children from sorrow. God is our Supreme Father, the Supreme teacher, a guide, a friend and everyone that we need for. We have a beautiful loving relationship with Him and therefore we all pray and remember him in many ways in our difficult times.</b><big></big><b></p>

<p><b><big>Respected Rajyogini Dr. Dadi Janki ji, the Chief Administrative Head of Brahma Kumaris left her body of 104 years at 2.00am on 27 March, 2020 Mount Abu, India. We radiate love, respect and gratitude to her as she moves on her journey of being God’s Instrument to shift the world towards peace, purity and divinity.

At the age of 104 she served the world for 18 hours a day through her love and wisdom.

Awarded as “the most stable mind in the world” she guided everyone in the organization which is spread across 140 countries.

Being the Chief Administrative Head from the age of 91 she was an epitome of selfless service, peace and humility.<br>
For over 80 years she asked audiences on all continents to consider 3 questions:

Who am I?
Who do I belong to?
What is the task of this time?
The answers:

You are a soul
You belong to God
This is the time of world transformation
She was a tireless server. From her early days in what is now Pakistan to a few months before her passing, she gave every moment to service, outpacing those who were decades younger. She spoke to princes, prime ministers and those leading ordinary lives as if they were her brothers and sisters, urging them to make their lives worthwhile.

She was a spiritual giant, who kept a lamp of hope lit for humanity. She showed us how to live with love and ultimately how to die with dignity.

She was born in 1916 in Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan. 

She went to school only for 3 years. 

At the age of 21, she surrendered her life to the organisation to serve the world. 

In 1970 she started the service of Brahma Kumaris outside India, in London. Her renunciation and love for God gave her the strength to spread God’s message in over 100 countries. 

She stayed outside India for 37 years till 2007. Since then till 2020 she was at Mount Abu, Rajasthan India as the Chief Administrative Head. 

Most Stable Mind In The World
She was given the title of ‘Most Stable Mind Of the World’ by Texas Medical and Science Institute.  Her thoughts were so controlled that she could stabilise her mind on a thought for as long as she wanted. 

In 2015 she was nominated as the Brand Ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission. 

She was awarded a doctorate by Geetam University, Vishakhapatnam in 2012 for her commendable contribution to worldwide education and spirituality.

<p><b><big>Dadi Gulzaar aka Dadi Hridaya Mohini is currently the Administrative head of Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Godly Spiritual University. Dadi Gulzar joined the Yagya (institution) at an age of 8, at its very beginning (around 1936) through a boarding school for children called 'Om Niwas' founded by Dada Lekhraj (then renamed Brahma baba). Dadi's age is around 92 years</big></b></p>

<p><big><b>Early Spiritual life of Dadi Gulzar was full of joy and intoxication of being a child of God (as in those days Murli was spoken mainly on the coming New world (Satyug). This was the very initial teachings by Shiv baba through Dada Lekhraj (Brahma baba). She was a child and thus had no background knowledge of Vedas. Yet listening to Baba's Murli, she used to experience deep love and joy.

In those days (the 1940s), she started having visions of the Satyug during meditation. Not even Brahma baba or Mamma would have any visions, but a few little children including Gulzar received visions of the new age. After coming back in consciousness, she would tell everyone what she saw. This was common in those days (in Karachi - 1939 to 1950)</b></big></p>

<p><b><big>After 1950, the group relocated in Mount Abu upon Baba's direction. Dadi Gulzar was then mature enough both physically and spiritually and hence Baba sent Dadi to services around Bharat (India) and through Dadi, many centres were established. In those days in 1950s, service was growing rapidly and hence everyone was given their duties to perform. Mamma was managing the service and Brahma baba was managing other activities in Madhuban. Hereby, part of Dadi Gulzar was on spiritual service and the part for having visions (of Sandeshi) was over.

​

In 1960s, services in India was widespread and scientific resources came up to help in service. Through telephone, Baba use to speak to children and give important direction. Writing letters continues. Dadi Gulzar was mainly serving in Bombay and Delhi regions. ''Everyone loved Dadi for her sweetness and unconditional love.'' Even Baba said in Murli about Gulzaar being most serviceable in Bombay region.
